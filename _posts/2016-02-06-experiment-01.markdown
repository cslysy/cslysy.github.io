Libraries/Dependencies/Packages - there are many names for reusable pieces of code. We are using them from the begin of software engineering. They are great in terms of saving hours, days or weeks of development. The point is that they are hard to manage manually. Downloading library by hand from author webpage is no a best way. Storing libraries on disk, or worse, keeping it in [SCM][scm] is really bad idea. Java world, for example, has their [maven][mvn] to automate dependencies management. It works ok with jars not with java scripts. How modern web resolve this problem...

###Aim
Setup project in a way that their dependencies will be managed by npm.
###Materials
[Node package manager][npm] (npm)
###Procedure
Project initialization
{% highlight bash %}
npm init
{% endhighlight %}
This comment is a heart of npm. As a result [package.json][package.json] file will be created.
